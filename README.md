# araignee

Araignee is an attempt to create a HTTP request router on top of beast library. It is heavily inspired by the routing mechanism in [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

Note, that this is pre alpha code. It is more a suggestion to where this might lead, than usable code. use at own risk, or better, don't use at all at the moment.

## How to use

It is to early to try and use this even in experimental code. So don't. As soon as I have some code in test.cpp that actually runs as a webserver, I'll start to describe the usage here.
